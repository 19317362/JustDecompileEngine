## Working with JustDecompile Engine

JustDecompile UI remains private at this time. JustDecompile, however, has rich console functionality and that has been opensourced here.
One can use the console project generation feature to see the results of the changes made to the engine. The ConsoleRunner project
is a console app that exposes that functionality and makes testing easy. When started it prints out all the available commands and switches.
